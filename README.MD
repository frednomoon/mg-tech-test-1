# Music Tribe Technical Assignment - React

### Installation and usage

```
yarn && yarn start
```

## The challenge

Behold, one of the most horribly written react projects you have seen since "my-first-react-project". Since we don't want to waste your time setting up react projects,or writing repetitive rubbish, we have written a functioning React app, which retrieves and displays some data from the Discogs API.

We want you to improve this project in 2 ways. Primarily, because we want to see how well you understand React, we would like you to refactor the React code to use whatever _you_ consider best practices. As the 2nd part we want you to improve the app in another way of your choosing. In this part it would be great to see you showcase some skills other than React, or even just some creativity. Some ideas could be to add styling or new features, but it is really up to you.

### What we want to see
 - Clean, organised, readable code.
 - Maintainable, performant React.
 - Modern web tech / features.
 - Creativity, and a sense of humour.

### What we don't want to see
 - How good you are at installing NPM packages.
